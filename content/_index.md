# About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

My name is Kevin Sohn. My friends call me Min.

As SRE and Release Manager, my last position involved collaborating with cross-functional teams. I was excited to serve as the point of contact for taking projects from zero to one, building and managing processes such as CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, containerization, and infrastructure-as-code. The smartphone projects I led as a QA Lead and Audio Test Engineer at Samsung were used by millions of users every day. I currently handle high-profile cases to resolve issues with Kubernetes and containers on Azure.
